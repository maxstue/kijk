We have an `.editorconfig` setup with a basic rules but still best practices for c#/dotnet code.

## Client

We use eslint/tslint with `recommended-type-checked` && `stylistic-type-checked` and settings and prettier with auto formatting.

## Web

We use eslint/tslint, next with `@typescript-eslint/recommended` && `recommended-requiring-type-checking` settings and prettier with auto formatting.
