## 🧐 Motivation <a name = "motivation"></a>

At the core of Kijk is my motivation to explore new technologies while crafting an app that caters to every user, including myself. I embarked on this journey to create a household app that simplifies energy/resource monitoring, driven by my own need for such a tool.
I invite you, as new users, to join this project. Let's collaborate on this open-source project, combining our skills to make Kijk an even more valuable asset for household management. Your participation and contributions will not only enhance the app's features but also ensure that it addresses a wider array of needs and preferences. Together, we can shape a tool that empowers us all to manage our homes efficiently and effortlessly.
